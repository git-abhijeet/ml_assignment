## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### Import Errors

```bash
# Update all packages
pip install --upgrade numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# For conda users
conda update --all
```

### Memory Issues

-   Close unnecessary applications
-   Restart Jupyter kernel between assignments
-   Reduce dataset size for testing if needed

### Slow Performance

-   Use smaller parameter grids for hyperparameter tuning
-   Set `n_jobs=1` for debugging
-   Consider using fewer cross-validation folds

### Visualization Problems

```python
# Add this to notebook cells
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('default')
```
