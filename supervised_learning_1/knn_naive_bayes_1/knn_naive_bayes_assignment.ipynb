    "# Theory Section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: What is the intuition behind the KNN algorithm? How does it make a prediction for a new data point?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is based on the principle that **\"similar things exist in close proximity\"**. The algorithm assumes that data points with similar characteristics (features) will be located close to each other in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How KNN makes predictions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distance Calculation**: For a new data point, KNN calculates the distance between this point and all training data points using a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find K Neighbors**: It identifies the K closest training data points (neighbors) to the new point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Majority Voting**: For classification, it assigns the class label that appears most frequently among the K neighbors. For regression, it averages the target values of the K neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lazy Learning**: KNN is called a \"lazy learner\" because it doesn't build an explicit model during training. Instead, it stores all training data and performs computation only when a prediction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If K=5 and among the 5 nearest neighbors, 3 belong to class A and 2 belong to class B, the new point is classified as class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Discuss how Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances differ and their implications in KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Metrics Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Euclidean Distance:**\n",
    "- **Formula**: $d = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}$\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points\n",
    "- **Implications**: \n",
    "  - Most commonly used and intuitive\n",
    "  - Sensitive to outliers due to squaring differences\n",
    "  - Works well when all features have similar scales\n",
    "  - Assumes equal importance of all dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Manhattan Distance (L1 norm):**\n",
    "- **Formula**: $d = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|$\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Measures distance along axis-aligned paths (like city blocks)\n",
    "- **Implications**:\n",
    "  - More robust to outliers than Euclidean distance\n",
    "  - Better for high-dimensional sparse data\n",
    "  - Useful when movement is constrained to grid-like paths\n",
    "  - Less sensitive to irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Minkowski Distance:**\n",
    "- **Formula**: $d = (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|^p)^{1/p}$\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Generalization of both Euclidean (p=2) and Manhattan (p=1) distances\n",
    "- **Implications**:\n",
    "  - When p=1: Reduces to Manhattan distance\n",
    "  - When p=2: Reduces to Euclidean distance\n",
    "  - When p→∞: Reduces to Chebyshev distance (maximum difference)\n",
    "  - Provides flexibility to tune the distance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "- **Feature scaling** is crucial for Euclidean and Minkowski distances\n",
    "- **High-dimensional data**: Manhattan distance often performs better\n",
    "- **Outlier presence**: Manhattan distance is more robust\n",
    "- **Domain knowledge**: Choose based on the nature of your problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: Mention three advantages and three drawbacks of using KNN in practical settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Simplicity and Interpretability:**\n",
    "- Easy to understand and implement\n",
    "- No assumptions about data distribution\n",
    "- Results are easily interpretable (you can see the actual neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. No Training Period:**\n",
    "- Lazy learning approach - no model building phase\n",
    "- Can immediately incorporate new training data\n",
    "- Adapts well to changing data patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Effective for Non-linear Relationships:**\n",
    "- Can capture complex decision boundaries\n",
    "- Works well with irregular data patterns\n",
    "- No need to specify functional form of the relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "- **Training**: O(1) - just stores data\n",
    "- **Prediction**: O(n) - must calculate distance to all training points\n",
    "- Becomes very slow with large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sensitive to Irrelevant Features and Scaling:**\n",
    "- All features contribute equally to distance calculation\n",
    "- Requires feature scaling/normalization\n",
    "- Performance degrades with high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sensitive to Local Structure of Data:**\n",
    "- Susceptible to noise and outliers\n",
    "- Poor performance with imbalanced datasets\n",
    "- Choice of K value significantly affects performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4: What is conditional probability, and how is it related to the working of Naive Bayes classifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship to Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are fundamentally based on **Bayes' Theorem**, which uses conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' Theorem**: $P(Class|Features) = \\frac{P(Features|Class) \\times P(Class)}{P(Features)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Naive Bayes context:**\n",
    "- $P(Class|Features)$: **Posterior probability** - probability of a class given the features\n",
    "- $P(Features|Class)$: **Likelihood** - probability of observing features given the class\n",
    "- $P(Class)$: **Prior probability** - probability of the class in the dataset\n",
    "- $P(Features)$: **Evidence** - probability of observing the features (normalization constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. For each class, calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem\n",
    "2. Assign the class with the highest posterior probability\n",
    "3. The \"naive\" assumption treats all features as conditionally independent given the class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: For email spam classification:\n",
    "- P(Spam|\"free\", \"money\", \"offer\") = probability that email is spam given it contains words \"free\", \"money\", \"offer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5: Why is the assumption of independence critical in Naive Bayes? What are the consequences if this assumption fails?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Independence Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes states that **all features are conditionally independent given the class label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical representation:**\n",
    "$P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n|Class) = P(x_1|Class) \\times P(x_2|Class) \\times ... \\times P(x_n|Class)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's Critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Computational Simplicity:**\n",
    "- Reduces complex joint probability calculations to products of individual probabilities\n",
    "- Makes the algorithm tractable for high-dimensional data\n",
    "- Enables efficient computation and storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Parameter Estimation:**\n",
    "- Instead of estimating $2^n$ parameters for joint distribution, only need $n$ parameters\n",
    "- Reduces risk of overfitting with limited training data\n",
    "- Makes the algorithm robust with small datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consequences When Independence Fails:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Theoretical Issues:**\n",
    "- **Probability estimates become inaccurate**: The calculated probabilities may not represent true probabilities\n",
    "- **Over-confidence in predictions**: The model may be overly certain about its predictions\n",
    "- **Suboptimal decision boundaries**: May not capture the true relationship between features\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Practical Consequences:**\n",
    "- **Still often works well**: Despite violated assumptions, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well\n",
    "- **Robust to moderate correlations**: Performance degradation is often gradual\n",
    "- **Good relative ranking**: Even if absolute probabilities are wrong, relative ranking of classes often remains good\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Examples of Assumption Violation:**\n",
    "- **Text classification**: Words in a document are often correlated (e.g., \"machine\" and \"learning\" often appear together)\n",
    "- **Medical diagnosis**: Symptoms are often correlated with each other\n",
    "- **Image recognition**: Pixel values are spatially correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "- Feature selection to remove highly correlated features\n",
    "- Use of other classifiers when independence is severely violated\n",
    "- Ensemble methods combining Naive Bayes with other algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6: Differentiate between the types of Naive Bayes classifiers and their suitability for different data types.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Suitable for**:\n",
    "  - Imbalanced text classification datasets\n",
    "  - When Multinomial NB shows bias toward frequent classes\n",
