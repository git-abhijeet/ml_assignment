Bar chart shows rice dominates with highest allocation, followed by wheat, then maize.

### 2. Yearly Production - Rice

**Year with highest rice production**: 2016
**Peak production**: 117,614 thousand tons

Line chart reveals steady growth from 1966 with acceleration post-2000, peaking in 2016.

### 3. State Production - Wheat

**Highest wheat production**: Uttar Pradesh (970,210 thousand tons)
**Lowest wheat production**: Kerala (0 thousand tons)

Horizontal bar chart shows Uttar Pradesh dominates, followed by Punjab and Haryana.

### 4. Crop Yields - Sorghum

**Average yield**: 818 kg per hectare
**Median yield**: 755 kg per hectare
**Standard deviation**: 477 kg per hectare

Box plot shows right-skewed distribution with several high-yield outliers above 2,000 kg/ha.

### 5. Vegetable Area

**Total vegetable area**: 178,999 thousand hectares
**State with maximum area**: Orissa (30,205 thousand hectares)

Pie chart shows Orissa leads with 16.9%, followed by West Bengal and Maharashtra.

## Medium Questions

### 1. Area vs Production Correlation - Chickpea

**Correlation coefficient**: 0.9085 (strong positive correlation)
**P-value**: 0.0000 (highly significant)

Scatter plot with trend line confirms strong linear relationship between chickpea area and production.

### 2. Diversity of Crops

Number of crops produced per state:

-   **Highest diversity**: Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar (27 crops each)
-   **Lowest diversity**: Assam, Kerala (18 crops each)

Bar chart shows most states produce 24-27 different crops, indicating high agricultural diversity.

## Hard Questions

### 1. Longitudinal Yield Trends - Major Pulses

Yield improvements from 1966-2017:

-   **Chickpea**: 348 → 1,032 kg/ha (+197%)
-   **Pigeonpea**: 325 → 855 kg/ha (+163%)
-   **Minor Pulses**: 141 → 943 kg/ha (+571%)

Line chart shows remarkable yield growth for all pulses, with minor pulses showing most dramatic improvement.

### 2. Sorghum Production Patterns

**Kharif sorghum**: Grown in 276 districts
**Rabi sorghum**: Grown in 128 districts

**Top Kharif districts (Maharashtra dominance)**:

-   Osmanabad: 12,623 thousand ha
-   Nanded: 10,619 thousand ha
-   Akola: 10,295 thousand ha

**Top Rabi districts**:

-   Solapur: 35,944 thousand ha
-   Ahmednagar: 28,129 thousand ha
-   Pune: 21,787 thousand ha

Heatmap reveals Maharashtra's dominance in both seasons, with distinct seasonal patterns across districts.

## Key Insights
